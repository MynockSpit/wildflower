  "description": "1. Install wildflower. (It requires `sudo` access, but just to install to usr/bin/local and give it exec permissions. Go read it. It's three lines.)     ```sh     curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MynockSpit/wildflower/master/install.sh | sh     ``` 2. Install Deno (or let wildflower install Deno for you.) 3. Create a new directory where you'll store your dotfiles (e.g. `valley`). 4. Run `wildflower till`. This will create a sample `meadows.js` (e.g. `valley/meadows.js`) to use as a starting-point. 5. Add files you want to gather to the `meadows.js`. 6. Run `wildflower gather` to collect all the files you've specified in `meadows.js`. 7. Store the contents of `./valley` any way you like.",
